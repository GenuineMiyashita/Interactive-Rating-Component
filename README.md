## My process

This was a struggle for me. I was busy for roughly the last 2 weeks when I came back, it felt as if I completely forgot everything! The HTML & CSS was taking forever as I really wanted to try to include Bulma since I learned about the CSS framework from my Udemy course -- [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). However, I removed all of it and started from scratch again. After a while, I was getting frustrated with trying to pixel perfect the CSS, maybe, I was just distracting myself so I didn't have to work on the JavaScript portion as this was also my first project that included JS outside of the Udemy course's small quizzes.

I ended up watching TsbSankara's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnUopEeZgw) about the challenge and turned it into a code along to push/force myself to the JavaScript section where I paused before each line of code and attempted it myself. I understand the basic Syntax, but it was the event listeners in real practice that I couldn't remember how to setup.

### What I learned

Before removing Bulma, I read a large chunk of their documentation and even though it isn't used -- I learned a lot about it. Additionally, TsbSankara's video helped me understand the proper structure of an event listener as I understand the basic syntax, just struggle to apply it until I get extra practice. Furthermore, I corrected my CSS based off the video and while I have a better understanding of CSS compared JS, I still learned a clearer understanding of the flexbox hierarchy as I always initially mess it up by making the main tag the main container class.

### Continued development

I need to continue working on JavaScript, refresh myself on HTML/CSS, and really practice extra CSS too. The way I plan to address working with JavaScript is by following along other beginner level tutorials and afterwards, attempting the same/similar project on my own. I purchased the [JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/) on sale from Udemy. Those will be the projects that I attempt on my own and use the videos as a way to code-review myself. Additionally, I bought Colt Steele's [The HTML & CSS Bootcamp 2023 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/html-and-css-bootcamp/) while on launch sale to mainly revisit CSS. I'm mainly an audio learner and Colt's method has been helpful in his generalized course, so I wanted to take his specialized course and tackle those projects too.

Furthermore, I want to improve in accessibility and have stared to read [Dev](dev.to) and found Grace Snow and her website [fedmentor](fedmentor.dev) from Frontend Mentor.
